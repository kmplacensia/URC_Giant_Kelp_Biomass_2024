# PURPOSE: Determine how frond biomass varies with depth from both North 1958 and Rassweiler 2018
#K.P. Create a graph that shows how giant kelp biomass has increased each year on PVR from 2020 - 2023. Determine how to calculate biomass values on each module from stipe density values (because stipe density is a proxy for frond density).

#North et al. 1958 conducted a study on M. pyrifera to determine how much giant kelp was present in the Papalote Bed during different months of the year. Due to weathering kelp beds were not present in October and December of 1957, but thick kelp beds were observed from a campsite on shore in May 1957. Then again in May of 1958 aerial surveys revealed that the bed was once again existent. Between May and July 1957 juvenile plants appeared and better growing conditions allowed for the formation of a canopy/
# The North team collected data on giant kelp juveniles at depths from 20 to 25 m, as well as from depths from 4 to 25 m. North 1958 estimated the average weight of a stipes plus attached pneumatocysts and blades for depths of around 18 m; around the depth at which the VRG completed ARM surveys. The data set by North provides the mass of all weighed kelp fronds from this experiment.
#This data set will provide us with the depth and mass of each sampled and collected frond from the North 1958 experiment from June, July, and August of 1958.

# Rassweiler completed more than a decade long study to determine the relationship between NPP and biomass, and through their dive surveys they were able to create a data set that estimates the seasonal biomass, growth and NPP for the five years covered by the Reed and Rassweiler publication (2002-2006) and with a decade long of additional data (2007 - 2017).

#By looking at the summary of Survey Depths in meters from the dive surveys conducted at PVR we can determine whether the biomass estimates postulated by North and Rassweiler are applicable to our data set. The best way to project the biomass values from Rassweiler and Reed is to make sure that the depths at which they completed their surveys is similar to the depth at which we collected PVR ARM data as well.
# We see that the minimum depth of dive surveys completed by the VRG at PVR was 15.2 m, and the maximum depth was 21.6 m *ZoÃ« note:(keep in mind this is dive computer data, so it's rough). The mean depth of PVR surveys were 18.42 m.
