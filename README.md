Title of project: Increase in Giant Kelp Biomass and Carbon Storage after the Construction of an Artificial Reef in the Southern California Bight


Abstract: As a primary producer, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) helps mitigate the effects of climate change by absorbing dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) from the ocean, and therefore the atmosphere, as organic carbon (C) used as plant biomass. In 2020, the Vantuna Research Group (VRG) in collaboration with the Southern California Marine Institute (SCMI), The Bay Foundation, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) built the Palos Verdes Artificial Reef (PVR) in a shallow subtidal portion of the Palos Verdes (PV) Peninsula in Los Angeles County. The construction of PVR included the development of eighteen artificial reef modules, and by 2021 all modules had recruited rocky-reef associated taxa including giant kelp. Estimating the amount of giant kelp biomass produced on PVR can be used as a method to determine the amount of carbon stored by developing giant kelp forests. In this study we used historic VRG dive data to determine giant kelp stipe (frond) density per each moduleâ€™s surface area (m2) to then estimate frond biomass using a linear regression model to predict the weight of a single frond based on depth using two historic dive data sets. We found that kelp biomass on PVR increased within a year of installation, and this increase in giant kelp biomass led to an increase in carbon storage. An improved understanding of how kelp forest ecosystems associated with artificial reefs can increase kelp biomass, and therefore local CO2 absorption, can inform coastal communities of the benefits of using artificial reefs to combat the adverse effects of global climate change.
